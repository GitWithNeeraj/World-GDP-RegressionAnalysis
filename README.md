# World-GDP-RegressionAnalysis
Analyzing the World GDP data from the World BanK to estimate the long-term annual growth rate of the world using regression techniques
# World GDP Analysis

## Project Overview
This project involves analyzing the World GDP data from the World Bank. The aim is to estimate the long-term annual growth rate of the world using regression techniques. 

## Problem Statement
The task is to download and analyze the World GDP data. The specific objectives are:
- Apply a logarithmic transformation to linearize the exponential growth of GDP over time.
- Perform a linear regression on the transformed data and plot the results.
- Compute and analyze the residuals of the regression.
- Conduct a Kolmogorov-Smirnov test to examine the distribution of the residuals.
- Apply the inverse transformation to the regression model and compare it with the original GDP data.
- Calculate the long-term growth rate of the World GDP and analyze trends post-2015.
